# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
~~~
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: G.Pavithra
RegisterNumber: 21500148
*/
a=int(input())
b=2
print('Exponentiation of a given number:',pow(a,b))
~~~

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](expo1.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
